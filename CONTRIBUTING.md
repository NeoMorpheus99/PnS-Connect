# Contributing

You can contribute in several ways:

- Reporting a bug or suggesting a feature in the `Issues` section
- Submitting a fix to the aforementioned issues
- Critiquing the design of the code
- Updating the documentation

## All changes happen only through PRs

This project uses Github to host the code, track issues and accept pull requests.
It also uses [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so pull requests are the only way to make changes to the code.

## Issuing a PR

When issuing a pull request make sure to follow these steps:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
- Make changes you think are neccessary
- Add tests (if needed)
- Update the documentation (if needed)
- Issue the pull request!

## Reporting a bug

When reporting a bug, make sure to mention the following:

- Your OS
- Python version
- Steps to reproduce (be specific)
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your thoughts on what we can do to fix it
- Screenshots are not neccessary, but welcome
